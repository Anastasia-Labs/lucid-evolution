# Make Wallet From Seed

Similar to instantiating a wallet object from seed without binding it with the Lucid object by calling the [`walletFromSeed`](../) function, you can instantiate a wallet from seed by calling the `makeWalletFromSeed(){:js}` function to get a wallet object with some functionalities, such as signing and submitting transactions (not just the `{ address, rewardAddress, paymentKey, stakeKey }{:js}` fields).

## Steps to Create a Wallet Object

<Steps>
### Specify the Provider

It can be [Blockfrost](https://blockfrost.io/), [Koios](https://koios.rest/), [Maestro](https://gomaestro.org/), etc. Even a custom provider, as long as it implements the [`Provider`](../../provider) interface.

For example, here's how to instantiate a Blockfrost provider:

```js showLineNumbers
import { Blockfrost, Provider } from "@lucid-evolution/lucid";

const blockfrostURL: string = process.env.BF_URL!;
const blockfrostPID: string = process.env.BF_PID!;

const blockfrost: Provider = new Blockfrost(
  blockfrostURL, // The endpoint based on the Cardano network, please refer to Blockfrost documentation
  blockfrostPID, // Your secret Blockfrost Project ID
);
```

<Callout>
  Other providers follow a similar pattern.
</Callout>

### Create the Wallet Object

```js showLineNumbers /makeWalletFromSeed/ {5-6}
import { makeWalletFromSeed, Network } from "@lucid-evolution/lucid";

const provider = blockfrost;
const network: Network = "Mainnet"; // "Mainnet" | "Preview" | "Preprod" | "Custom"
const seedPhrase = "your seed phrase here ...";
const wallet = makeWalletFromSeed(provider, network, seedPhrase); // CIP-30
```
</Steps>
