# Governance

Conway era introduces significant on-chain governance features to the Cardano blockchain, as outlined in [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-1694). These features enable ADA holders to participate in on-chain decisions through a system of delegation and direct voting.

## ADA Holder

An ADA holder can participate in on-chain governance by delegating the voting power to a Delegated Representative (DRep) or by becoming a DRep.

### Delegating to a DRep

The following is an example of how you can delegate voting power to a DRep:

```js showLineNumbers {3,8}
// you can convert a DRep ID to Credential
const drepId = "drep1_...";
const drepCredential = drepIDToCredential(drepId);

// transaction construction
await lucid
  .newTx()
  .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, drepCredential)
  .complete();

// proceed with sign and submit tx...
```

### Becoming a DRep

To become a Delegated Representative (DRep), you need a registered stake address. Here's how you can register the stake address:

```js showLineNumbers {2,7}
// you can query the reward address of the connected wallet
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet().rewardAddress();

// transaction construction
await lucid
  .newTx()
  .register.DRep(rewardAddress)
  .complete();

// proceed with sign and submit tx...
```

## DRep

A Delegated Representative (DRep) can accept voting delegation and participate directly in governance actions.

### Update Info

You can update DRep metadata like the following:

```js showLineNumbers {2,7}
// you can query the reward address of the connected wallet
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet().rewardAddress();

// transaction construction
await lucid
  .newTx()
  .updateDRep(rewardAddress, anchor)
  .complete();

// proceed with sign and submit tx...
```

### Deregistration

To deregister from a DRep, you can do the following:

```js showLineNumbers {2,7}
// you can query the reward address of the connected wallet
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet().rewardAddress();

// transaction construction
await lucid
  .newTx()
  .deregister.DRep(rewardAddress)
  .complete();

// proceed with sign and submit tx...
```

### Script DRep

For programmatic voting, you can create a script-based DRep:

```js showLineNumbers {2,7,8}
// you can query the reward address of the connected wallet
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet().rewardAddress();

// transaction construction
await lucid
  .newTx()
  .register.DRep(rewardAddress)
  .attach.Script(script)
  .complete();

// proceed with sign and submit tx...
```

**Use-cases**:

- Voting according to predefined community policies
- Implementing voting thresholds based on specific metrics
- Creating specialized voting strategies for institutions

## Utility Functions

This sections covers convenience functions for common governance operations.

### Register and Delegate to a DRep

This allows you to register and delegate to a DRep as a single action:

```js showLineNumbers {2,6,11}
// you can query the reward address of the connected wallet
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet().rewardAddress();

// you can convert a DRep ID to Credential
const drepId = "drep1_...";
const drepCredential = drepIDToCredential(drepId);

// transaction construction
await lucid
  .newTx()
  .registerAndDelegate.ToDrep(rewardAddress, drepCredential)
  .complete();

// proceed with sign and submit tx...
```

### Register and Delegate to a Pool and DRep

This allows you to register and delegate to a Pool and a DRep as a single action:

```js showLineNumbers {2,5,9,14}
// you can query the reward address of the connected wallet
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet().rewardAddress();

// you need to provide the Pool ID
const poolId = "pool1_...";

// you can convert a DRep ID to Credential
const drepId = "drep1_...";
const drepCredential = drepIDToCredential(drepId);

// transaction construction
await lucid
  .newTx()
  .registerAndDelegate.ToPoolAndDRep(rewardAddress, poolId, drepCredential)
  .complete();

// proceed with sign and submit tx...
```

### Delegate to a Pool and DRep

This allows you to delegate to a Pool and a DRep as a single action:

```js showLineNumbers {2,5,9,14}
// you can query the reward address of the connected wallet
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet().rewardAddress();

// you need to provide the Pool ID
const poolId = "pool1_...";

// you can convert a DRep ID to Credential
const drepId = "drep1_...";
const drepCredential = drepIDToCredential(drepId);

// transaction construction
await lucid
  .newTx()
  .delegate.VoteToPoolAndDrep(rewardAddress, poolId, drepCredential)
  .complete();

// proceed with sign and submit tx...
```

## Understanding Delegation Certificates

When you delegate your voting power, Lucid-Evolution creates a certificate that is included in the transaction. Behind the scenes, this is handled by the `Certificate.new_vote_deleg_cert(){:js}` method in CML. The certificate contains:

- Stake credential derived from your reward address
- DRep you're delegating to
- Voting strategy (whether a specific DRep, `Always Abstain`, or `Always No Confidence`)
