# Staking

This section covers the operations for staking your wallet on the Cardano network.

## Register Stake Key

The first step before you can delegate stake to a pool, you must register the stake key first. When registering a stake key with the Cardano network, a deposit of **2 ADA** is required. This deposit acts as a pledge and is temporarily deducted from the wallet balance. The amount will be refunded upon [stake deregistration](#deregister-stake-key).

The following is the minimal transaction construction:

```js showLineNumbers /registerStake/ {2,7}
// you can query the reward address of the connected wallet
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet().rewardAddress();

// transaction construction
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .registerStake(rewardAddress)
  .complete();

// proceed with sign and submit tx...
```

## Delegate to a Pool

Delegating to a stake pool involves associating a stake key with a pool identified by its unique Pool ID.

The following is the minimal transaction construction:

```js showLineNumbers /delegateTo/ {2,7}
// you can query the reward address of the connected wallet
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet().rewardAddress();

// transaction construction
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .delegateTo(rewardAddress, "pool1_...")
  .complete();

// proceed with sign and submit tx...
```

<Callout>
  **You can combine both `registration` and `delegation` into a single transaction:**
  
  ```js showLineNumbers {4}
  // transaction construction
  const tx = await lucid
    .newTx()
    .registerAndDelegate.ToPool(rewardAddress, "pool1_...")
    .complete();
  ```
</Callout>

## Withdraw Rewards

This action allows the wallet holder to claim any rewards accumulated through staking. The rewards are withdrawn to the wallets balance.

The following is the minimal transaction construction:

```js showLineNumbers /withdraw/ {2,5,10}
// you can query the reward address of the connected wallet
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet().rewardAddress();

// you can also query the available stake rewards
const { rewards } = await lucid.wallet().getDelegation();

// transaction construction
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .withdraw(rewardAddress, rewards)
  .complete();

// proceed with sign and submit tx...
```

<Callout type="warning">
  After Vasil hardfork, stake rewards must be withdrawn fully. It cannot be withdrawn partially.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  After Chang hardfork, staking rewards are only withdrawable if the stake key is delegated to a DRep (Delegated Representative). For more information about DReps and governance delegation, see the [Governance documentation](/documentation/governance).
</Callout>

## Deregister Stake Key

Deregistering a stake key will reclaim the `2 ADA` depositted initially during [stake registration](#register-stake-key).

The following is the minimal transaction construction:

```js showLineNumbers /deRegisterStake/ {2,7}
// you can query the reward address of the connected wallet
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet().rewardAddress();

// transaction construction
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .deRegisterStake(rewardAddress)
  .complete();

// proceed with sign and submit tx...
```
