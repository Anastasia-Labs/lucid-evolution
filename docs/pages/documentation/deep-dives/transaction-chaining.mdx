## Transaction Chaining

<Steps>
### Problem Statement

Transaction chaining is a method with a purpose to address concurrency challenges inherent to Cardano’s eUTXO model by offering a decentralized alternative to the restrictive batching processes

### Solution

Transaction chaining sorts UTXOs on a “first-come-first-served” basis, enabling quicker transaction processing without off-chain batching. This method ensures that transactions not confirmed on-chain are simply reversed, preventing fund loss and improving throughput.

In this process, transactions enter the mempool for validation. Each transaction is tied to a specific UTXO state; changes in this state prevent transaction execution unless the original UTXO is present. This ensures that transactions are processed in the order they are received.

### Implementation in Lucid Evolution

```typescript
const [newWalletInputs, derivedOutputs, tx] = await user
  .newTx()
  .pay.ToAddressWithData(
    contractAddress,
    {
      kind: "inline",
      value: datum,
    },
    { lovelace: 10_000_000n }
  )
  .chain();

const signed = await tx.sign.withWallet().complete();
const txHash = await signed.submit();
```

</Steps>

## Components

- `newWalletInputs`: This includes all UTXOs that were not spent in the transaction and the new wallet UTXOs derived from the output transaction

- `derivedOutputs`: The derived outputs extracted from the completed transaction

- `tx`: The new transaction that is ready to be submitted

## Fresh set of UTXOs

To construct a new transaction using tx chaining, the UTXOs belonging to the wallet must be overridden. This is necessary because these UTXOs are not yet recorded on the blockchain.

```typescript
user.overrideUTxOs(newWalletInputs);
```

This function updates the wallet's UTXOs to set the new ones, ensuring the next transaction chaining can be constructed correctly.
