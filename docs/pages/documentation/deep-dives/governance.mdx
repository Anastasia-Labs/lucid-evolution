# Governance and Conway Era

Conway era introduces significant on-chain governance features to the Cardano blockchain,
as outlined in [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-1694).
These features enable ADA holders to participate in on-chain decisions through a system of delegation and direct voting.

<Callout>
  For all operations, you'll need a registered stake address. Learn more about
  stake address registration [here](/documentation/deep-dives/register-stake).

    As an ADA holder, you can participate in governance by delegating your voting power or voting directly.
    
    <Tabs items={['Delegate Voting Power', 'Predefined Strategies']}>
      <Tabs.Tab>
        
        You can delegate your voting power to a trusted Delegated Representative (DRep). If you have a DRep ID (starts with `drep1...`), convert it to a Credential:
        
  ```typescript
        import { drepIDToCredential } from "@lucid-evolution/lucid";
        
        // Convert DRep ID to Credential
        const drepId = "drep1...";
        const drepCredential = drepIDToCredential(drepId);
        
        // Use in transaction
        await lucid.newTx()
          .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, drepCredential)
          .complete();
        ```

        <Callout type="info">
        **Convenience Functions**

        **Register** your **stake address** and **delegate** voting power to a **DRep**:

        ```typescript
        await lucid.newTx()
          .registerAndDelegate.ToDrep(rewardAddress, drepCredential)
          .complete();
        ```
        **Register** your **stake address**, **delegate** to a **stake pool** and **DRep**:

        ```typescript
        await lucid.newTx()
          .registerAndDelegate.ToPoolAndDRep(rewardAddress, poolId, drepCredential)
          .complete();
        ```

        **Delegate** to a **stake pool** and **DRep**:

        ```typescript
        await lucid.newTx()
          .delegate.VoteToPoolAndDrep(rewardAddress, poolId, drepCredential)
          .complete();
        ```
        </Callout>
      </Tabs.Tab>

      <Tabs.Tab>

        Instead of delegating to a specific DRep, you can use predefined voting strategies:

        **Always Abstain**

        ```typescript
        await lucid.newTx()
          .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, {
            __typename: "AlwaysAbstain",
          })
          .complete();
        ```

        **Always No Confidence**

        ```typescript
        await lucid.newTx()
          .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, {
            __typename: "AlwaysNoConfidence",
          })
          .complete();
        ```
      </Tabs.Tab>

    </Tabs>

    ## Example

    Here's a complete example of delegating to a DRep:

        ```typescript
        import { Lucid, Blockfrost, drepIDToCredential } from "@lucid-evolution/lucid";

        // Initialize Lucid
        const lucid = await Lucid(
          new Blockfrost("https://cardano-mainnet.blockfrost.io/api/v0", "<blockfrost-api-key>"),
          "Mainnet"
        );

        // Select wallet
        lucid.selectWallet.fromPrivateKey(privateKey);

        // Get your reward address
        const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet().rewardAddress();

        // Convert DRep ID to credential
        const drepId = "drep1...";
        const drepCredential = drepIDToCredential(drepId);

        // Build, sign and submit transaction
        const tx = await lucid
          .newTx()
          .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, drepCredential) // or use a predefined strategy
          .complete();

        const signedTx = await tx.sign.withWallet().complete();
        const txHash = await signedTx.submit();
        ```
  </Tabs.Tab>

    As a Delegated Representative (DRep), you'll need a registered stake address to accept voting delegation and participate in governance actions.
    
    <Tabs items={['Register / Deregister', 'Update DRep Information', 'Script DReps']}>
      <Tabs.Tab>
        
        To register your stake address as a DRep:
        
  ```typescript
        await lucid.newTx()
          .register.DRep(rewardAddress)
          .complete();
        ```
        
        To deregister:
        
   ```typescript
        await lucid.newTx()
          .deregister.DRep(rewardAddress)
          .complete();
        ```
      </Tabs.Tab>
      
      <Tabs.Tab>
        
        You can update your metadata without reregistering:
        
  ```typescript
        await lucid.newTx()
          .updateDRep(rewardAddress, anchor)
          .complete();
        ```
        
      </Tabs.Tab>
      
      <Tabs.Tab>
        For programmatic voting, you can create a script-based DRep:
        
  ```typescript
        await lucid.newTx()
          .register.DRep(rewardAddress)
          .attach.Script(script)
          .complete();
        ```
        
        **Use Cases**
        
        - Voting according to predefined community policies
        - Implementing voting thresholds based on specific metrics
        - Creating specialized voting strategies for institutions

  <summary>Understanding Delegation Certificates</summary>
  When you delegate your voting power, Evolution library creates a certificate
  that's included in your transaction. Behind the scenes, this is handled by the
  `Certificate.new_vote_deleg_cert` method in CML. The certificate contains: -
  Stake credential derived from your reward address - DRep you're delegating to
  - Voting strategy (whether a specific DRep, Always Abstain, or Always No
  Confidence)
