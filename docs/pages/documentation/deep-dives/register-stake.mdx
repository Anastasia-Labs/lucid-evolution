## Staking your wallet

```typescript
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet().rewardAddress();
```

<Steps>
### Register stake key

When registering a stake key with the Cardano network, a deposit of `2 ADA` is required. This deposit acts as a pledge and is temporarily deducted from the wallet balance

```typescript
const tx = await lucid
    .newTx()
    .registerStake(rewardAddress)
    .complete();
```

---

### Delegate to a stake pool

Delegating to a stake pool involves associating your stake key with a pool identified by its unique ID

```typescript
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .delegateTo(rewardAddress, "poolabc...")
  .complete();
```

---

### Withdraw rewards

Allows the wallet holder to claim any rewards accumulated through staking. The rewards are withdrawn to the wallets balance

```typescript
const delegation = await lucid.wallet().getDelegation();

const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .withdraw(rewardAddress, delegation.rewards)
  .complete();
```

</Steps>

**Register and Delegate to a stake pool**

You can combine both registration and delegation into a single transaction too

```typescript
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .registerAndDelegateToPool(rewardAddress, "poolabc...")
  .complete();
```
</Callout>

## Deregister staking

Deregistering a stake key will reclaim the `2 ADA` deposit initially taken during registration.

```typescript
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .deRegisterStake(rewardAddress)
  .complete();
```
