## Staking your wallet

<Steps>
### Register stake key

When registering a stake key with the Cardano network, a deposit of `2 ADA` is required. This deposit acts as a pledge and is temporarily deducted from the wallet balance

```typescript
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet().rewardAddress();
const tx = await lucid.newTx().registerStake(rewardAddress).complete();

const signedTx = await tx.sign.withWallet().complete();
const txHash = await signedTx.submit();
```

### Delegate to a stake pool

Delegating to a stake pool involves associating your stake key with a pool identified by its unique ID

```typescript
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet().rewardAddress();
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .delegateTo(rewardAddress, "poolabc...")
  .complete();

const signedTx = await tx.sign.withWallet().complete();
const txHash = await signedTx.submit();
```

---

### Withdraw rewards

Allows the wallet holder to claim any rewards accumulated through staking. The rewards are withdrawn to the wallets balance

```typescript
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet().rewardAddress();
const delegation = await lucid.wallet().getDelegation();
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .withdraw(rewardAddress, delegation.rewards)
  .complete();

const signedTx = await tx.sign.withWallet().complete();
const txHash = await signedTx.submit();
```
</Steps>

## Deregister staking

Deregistering a stake key will reclaim the `2 ADA` deposit initially taken during registration.

```typescript
const rewardAddress = await lucid.wallet.rewardAddress();

const tx = await lucid.newTx().deregisterStake(rewardAddress).complete();

const signedTx = await tx.sign().complete();

const txHash = await signedTx.submit();
```
