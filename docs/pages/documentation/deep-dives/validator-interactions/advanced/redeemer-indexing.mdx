# Redeemer Indexing

Redeemer Indexing [design
pattern](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/design-patterns/blob/main/utxo-indexers/UTXO-INDEXERS.md)
leverages the deterministic script evaluation property of the Cardano ledger to
achieve substantial performance gains in onchain code.

In scenarios where the protocol necessitates spending from the script back to a
specific outputâ€”such as returning funds from the script to the same script,
directing them to another script, or transferring assets to a wallet, it is
imperative to ensure that each script input is uniquely associated with an
output.

This preventive measure is essential for mitigating the risk of [Double
Satisfaction
Attack](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/design-patterns/blob/main/stake-validator/STAKE-VALIDATOR.md#protect-against-double-satisfaction-exploit).

You can use a redeemer containing one-to-one correlation between script input
UTxOs and output UTxOs. This is provided via ordered lists of input/output
indices of required inputs/outputs present in the Script Context.

For example:

```
Inputs     : [scriptInputA, scriptInputB, randomInput1, scriptInputC, randomInput2, randomInput3]  // random inputs are not the concerned script inputs
Outputs    : [outputA, outputB, outputC, randomOutput1, randomOutput2, randomOutput3]
InputIdxs  : [0, 1, 3]
OutputIdxs : [0, 1, 2]
where type Redeemer = List<(inputIdx, outputIdx)>
```

While it is pretty straightforward to determine output indices (the order in
which ouputs are created during transaction building), obtaining input indices
is more involved. Currently, all inputs in a transaction need to be sorted
lexicographically (ascending order of transaction id and transaction
index). 

So even if a user obtains the required input indicies beforehand, coin
selection (post calculating the required fees and transaction balancing)
performed by a transaction builder could introduce new inputs thereby changing
the indices. Evolution library provides a high-level interface called
`RedeemerBuilder` that abstracts away this complexity and makes it easy to
obtain redeemer with required input indices.

## Redeemer Builder Kinds

<Tabs items={['Selected', 'Self']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```ts
    const redeemer: RedeemerBuilder = {
        kind: "selected",
        makeRedeemer: (inputIdxs: bigint[]) => {
            const tupleList = inputIdxs.map((inputIdx, i) => [inputIdx, BigInt(i)]); // List<(inputIdx, outputIdx)>
            return Data.to(tupleList);
        },
        inputs: scriptInputs,
    };
    ```
    This kind of redeemer builder takes in a list of *selected* inputs and
    provides `makeRedeemer` with their indices in the same order. The user
    supplied `makeRedeemer` function after having received the indices, builds
    the redeemer as per validator requirements which would typically involve
    mapping them to their corresponding output indices. Being a general purpose
    redeemer builder it can be used to create redeemers for `Spend`, `Mint` and `Withdraw` script purposes.

    ```typescript
    const scriptInputs: UTxO[] = [
      {
        txHash: "a",
        outputIndex: 1,
        address: "scriptAddress",
        assets: { lovelace: 10_000000n },
      },
      {
        txHash: "b",
        outputIndex: 2,
        address: "scriptAddress",
        assets: { lovelace: 20_000000n },
      },
      {
        txHash: "d",
        outputIndex: 4,
        address: "scriptAddress",
        assets: { lovelace: 40_000000n },
      },
    ];
    const randomInputs: UTxO[] = [
      {
        txHash: "c",
        outputIndex: 3,
        address: "randomAddress",
        assets: { lovelace: 30_000000n },
      },
      {
        txHash: "e",
        outputIndex: 5,
        address: "randomAddress",
        assets: { lovelace: 50_000000n },
      },
      {
        txHash: "f",
        outputIndex: 6,
        address: "randomAddress",
        assets: { lovelace: 60_000000n },
      },
    ];    

    const tx = await lucid
        .newTx()
        .collectFrom(scriptInputs, redeemer)
        .attach.SpendingValidator(script)
        .collectFrom(randomInputs)
        .pay.ToContract("scriptAddress", datum, { lovelace: 10_000000n })
        .pay.ToContract("scriptAddress", datum, { lovelace: 20_000000n })
        .pay.ToContract("scriptAddress", datum, { lovelace: 40_000000n })
        .pay.ToAddress("randomAddress", { lovelace: 30_000000n })
        .pay.ToAddress("randomAddress", { lovelace: 50_000000n })
        .pay.ToAddress("randomAddress", { lovelace: 60_000000n })
        .addSigner("randomAddress")
        .complete();
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```ts
      const redeemer: RedeemerBuilder = {
          kind: "self",
          makeRedeemer: (inputIdx: bigint) => {
              return Data.to(inputIdx);
          },
      };
    ```
    This is a specialized redeemer builder which can only be used with
    `collectFrom` endpoint i.e. `Spend` script purpose. It provides Spending
    Validators *index* of their spent input to find them more
    efficiently.
    ```rust
      validator simple_spend() {
        spend(_d: Option<Datum>, redeemer: Int, out_ref: OutputReference, tx: Transaction) {
          // Usual way of fetching input
          expect Some(input1) = transaction.find_input(tx.inputs, out_ref)
          // Optimized way
          expect Some(input2) = list.at(tx.inputs, redeemer)
          expect input2.output_reference == out_ref
        }
      }
    ```
    The usual way involves every input's output reference to be checked for
    equality against the provided one until a match is found. By using input
    index and equating the output reference only once, multiple equality
    checks are avoided, making it a more efficient approach.

   <Callout type="info">
    You may notice that no input is specified to this redeemer builder as one can
    be easily determined. There is an optional `inputs: UTxO[]` field
    present which is used internally by the library, its value overriden should
    it be set by a user.
