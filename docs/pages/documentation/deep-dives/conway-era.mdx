# Governance and Conway Era

The Conway era introduces significant on-chain governance features to the Cardano blockchain, as outlined in [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-1694). These enhancements enable ADA holders to participate in various on-chain decisions. Lucid Evolution now supports key governance actions, allowing users to engage in the democratic process of the Cardano ecosystem.

<Callout>Governance functionality documentation is actively being updated to reflect the latest features üõ†Ô∏è</Callout>

## For ADA Holders

As an ADA holder, you can participate in governance through various voting strategies and delegation options.

<Callout>
To be able to delegate your voting power, you must first register the associated stake address and query the reward address. Learn more about stake address registration [here](/documentation/deep-dives/register-stake).
</Callout>

### Voting Delegation

#### Delegate Vote
    Delegate your voting power to a specific DRep:
    ```typescript
    await lucid.newTx()
      .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, drep)
    ```

#### Register and Delegate
    Register a stake address and delegate voting power to a DRep in one action:
    ```typescript
    await lucid.newTx()
      .registerAndDelegate.ToDrep(rewardAddress, drep)
    ```

#### Delegate Vote and Stake

        Delegate both your ADA stake to a pool and your voting power to a DRep in one action:
    ```typescript
    await lucid.newTx()
      .delegate.VoteToPoolAndDrep(rewardAddress, poolId, drep)
    ```

    <Callout>
    You can also register a stake address, delegate to a pool, and vote to a DRep (e.g., `AlwaysAbstain`) in one action:

    ```typescript
    await lucid.newTx()
      .registerAndDelegate.ToPoolAndDRep(rewardAddress, poolId, {
        __typename: "AlwaysAbstain",
      })
    ```
    </Callout>

---

### Predefined Voting Strategies

#### Always Abstain
```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
    .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, {
      __typename: "AlwaysAbstain",
    })
```

#### Always No Confidence
```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
    .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, {
      __typename: "AlwaysNoConfidence",
    })
```

<Callout>
When using predefined strategies like `AlwaysAbstain` or `AlwaysNoConfidence`, ensure the DRep object has the `__typename` property set to the desired value
</Callout>

## For DReps
As a Delegated Representative (DRep), you can manage your status and information on the network.

### Managing DRep Status

  #### Register DRep
    Register a stake address as a DRep:
    ```typescript
    await lucid.newTx()
      .register.DRep(rewardAddress)
    ```

<Callout>
Remember to register the associated stake address before registering as a DRep. This way you will be able to query the reward address and update the DRep information. Learn more about stake address registration [here](/documentation/deep-dives/register-stake).
</Callout>

#### Update DRep

    Update DRep information:
    ```typescript
    await lucid.newTx()
      .updateDRep(rewardAddress)
    ```

#### Deregister DRep
    Deregister as a DRep:
    ```typescript
    await lucid.newTx()
      .deregister.DRep(rewardAddress)
    ```


## Script-based DReps

Lucid Evolution supports script-based DReps, enabling programmatic voting behavior for more complex governance strategies

<Steps>
<Tabs items={['Register Script DRep', 'Deregister Script  DRep']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```typescript
await lucid
  .newTx()
  .register.DRep(rewardAddress)
  .attach.Script(script)
```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
```typescript
await lucid
  .newTx()
  .deregister.DRep(rewardAddress)
```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>



</Steps>

## Example

To use these governance methods, initialize the `TxBuilder` configuration by calling `newTx()` after setting up Lucid:

```typescript
  // You can define a DRep object
  const drep: DRep = { __typename: "AlwaysAbstain" }; // Example AlwaysAbstain DRep

  // Create and complete the transaction
  const tx = await lucid
    .newTx()
    .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, drep)
    .complete();
```
