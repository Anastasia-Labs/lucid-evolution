# Governance and Conway Era

The Conway era introduces significant on-chain governance features to the Cardano blockchain, as outlined in [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-1694). These enhancements enable ADA holders to participate in various on-chain decisions. Lucid Evolution now supports key governance actions, allowing users to engage in the democratic process of the Cardano ecosystem.

## For ADA Holders

As an ADA holder, you can participate in governance through various voting strategies and delegation options.

<Callout type="info">
To be able to delegate your voting power, you must first register the associated stake address and query the reward address. Learn more about stake address registration [here](/documentation/deep-dives/register-stake).
</Callout>

### Voting Delegation

**Delegate your voting power to a specific DRep:**

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
  .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, drep)
```
---
**Register a stake address and delegate voting power to a DRep in one action:**

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
  .registerAndDelegate.ToDrep(rewardAddress, drep)
```

---

**Delegate both your ADA stake to a pool and your voting power to a DRep in one action:**

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
  .delegate.VoteToPoolAndDrep(rewardAddress, poolId, drep)
```

<Callout>
You can also register a stake address, delegate to a pool, and vote to a DRep (e.g., `AlwaysAbstain`) in one action:

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
  .registerAndDelegate.ToPoolAndDRep(rewardAddress, poolId, {
    __typename: "AlwaysAbstain",
  })
```
</Callout>

---

### Predefined Voting Strategies

**Always Abstain:**

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
    .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, {
      __typename: "AlwaysAbstain",
    })
```

---

**Always No Confidence:**

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
    .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, {
      __typename: "AlwaysNoConfidence",
    })
```

## For DReps
As a Delegated Representative (DRep), you can manage your status and information on the network.

### Managing DRep Status

**Register a stake address as a DRep:**

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
  .register.DRep(rewardAddress)
```



---

**Update DRep information:**

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
  .updateDRep(rewardAddress)
```

---

**Deregister a DRep stake address:**

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
  .deregister.DRep(rewardAddress)
```

<Callout>
Remember to register the associated stake address before registering as a DRep. This way you will be able to query the reward address and update the DRep information. Learn more about stake address registration [here](/documentation/deep-dives/register-stake).
</Callout>

## Script-based DReps

Lucid Evolution supports script-based DReps, enabling programmatic voting behavior for more complex governance strategies

---

**Register Script DRep:**

```typescript
await lucid
  .newTx()
  .register.DRep(rewardAddress)
  .attach.Script(script)
```

---

**Deregister Script DRep:**

```typescript
await lucid
  .newTx()
  .deregister.DRep(rewardAddress)
```

---

## Example

To use these governance methods, initialize the `TxBuilder` configuration by calling `newTx()` after setting up Lucid:

```typescript
  // You can define a DRep object
  const drep: DRep = { __typename: "AlwaysAbstain" }; // Example AlwaysAbstain DRep

  // Create and complete the transaction
  const tx = await lucid
    .newTx()
    .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, drep)
    .complete();
```
