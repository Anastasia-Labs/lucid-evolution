## Mint Assets

<Steps>
### Create a Minting Policy
First, we need to create a minting policy for the assets we want to mint. In this example, we'll use a native script time-locking policy with our wallet as the required signer:

```typescript
import { Lucid, Blockfrost } from "@lucid-evolution/lucid";
import {
  paymentCredentialOf,
  scriptFromNative,
  mintingPolicyToId,
  unixTimeToSlot,
} from "@lucid-evolution/utils";
import { fromText } from "@lucid-evolution/core-utils";

const address = await lucid.wallet().address();

const mintingPolicy = scriptFromNative({
  type: "all",
  scripts: [
    { type: "sig", keyHash: paymentCredentialOf(address).hash },
    {
      type: "before",
      slot: unixTimeToSlot(lucid.config().network, Date.now() + 1000000),
    },
  ],
});

```

---

Next we derive the policy id from the minting policy script:

```typescript
const policyID = mintingPolicyToId(mintingPolicy);
```

---

### Mint Assets

Now we can mint our desired tokens:

```typescript
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .mintAssets({
    [policyId + fromText("MyToken")]: 1n,
    [policyId + fromText("MyOtherToken")]: 1n,
  })
  .pay.ToAddress(address, { [policyId + fromText("MyToken")]: 1n })
  .validTo(Date.now() + 900000)
  .attach.MintingPolicy(mintingPolicy)
  .complete();

const signed = await tx.sign.withWallet().complete();
const txHash = await signed.submit();
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
__Evolution-Notes:__ `attach.MintingPolicy` -> `attachMintingPolicy`
</Callout>
<Callout>
Minting tokens creates them, but it doesn't automatically assign them to any address. After minting, the tokens are technically owned by the transaction itself. 
- Purpose of `pay.ToAddress()` is to send the newly minted tokens to a specific address
</Callout>
</Steps>

---

## Burn

To burn tokens, we use a similar process to minting, but with negative values for the assets we want to burn:

```typescript
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .mintAssets({
    [policyId + fromText("MyToken")]: -1n,
    [policyId + fromText("MyOtherToken")]: -1n,
  })
  .validTo(Date.now() + 900000)
  .attach.MintingPolicy(mintingPolicy)
  .complete();

const signed = await tx.sign.withWallet().complete();
const txHash = await signed.submit();
```

<Callout>
  - All assets minted in a single `mintAssets` call should be of the same policy
  id. You can chain multiple `mintAssets` calls if you need to mint assets with
  different policy ids
  - The minting policy must be attached to the transaction using `attach.MintingPolicy`
  - Lucid Evolution supports Native, PlutusV1, and PlutusV2 minting policies. The appropriate script type will be used based on
  the policy you attach. 
  - When using Plutus scripts (V1 or V2), make sure to provide an appropriate redeemer. 
  - The `validTo` field is important for
  time-locked minting policies to ensure the transaction is submitted within the
  valid time range
