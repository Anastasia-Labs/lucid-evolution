## Your first transaction

A couple fundamentals to remember are that in Cardano's eUTxO model, a transaction can consume one or more UTxOs as inputs. Create one or more UTxOs as outputs and that a transaction must be balanced (sum of inputs = sum of outputs + fees).

<Steps>
### Build

Let's create a simple transaction where we send `5 ADA` to two recipients each:

```typescript
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .pay.ToAddress("addr_testa...", { "lovelace": 5000000n })
  .pay.ToAddress("addr_testb...", { "lovelace": 5000000n })
  .complete();
```

<Callout>
  To balance the transaction and initiate coin selection, transactions always
  need to end with `.complete()`
</Callout>

### Sign

```typescript
const signedTx = await tx.sign.withWallet().complete();
```

You could also choose to sign the transaction with a private key:

```typescript
const signedTx = await tx.sign.withPrivateKey(privateKey).complete();
```

### Submit

Lastly we submit the transaction:

```typescript
const txHash = await signedTx.submit();
console.log(txHash);
```

</Steps>

<Callout>
  Remember to select a wallet before attempting to build and submit
  transactions. The wallet selection methods we discussed in previous section
  **[Core Concept 2: Choose Wallet](./core-concepts/choose-wallet)** should be implemented before building the
  transaction.
</Callout>

## Putting everything together

```typescript
import { Lucid, Blockfrost } from "@lucid-evolution/lucid";

// Initialize Lucid with a provider
const lucid = await Lucid(
  new Blockfrost("https://cardano-preprod.blockfrost.io/api/v0", "<projectId>"),
  "Preprod"
);

// Select a wallet for signing
lucid.selectWallet.fromPrivateKey(privateKey);

// Build, sign and submit transaction
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .pay.ToAddress("addr_testa...", { lovelace: 5000000n }) // Pay 5 ADA to addr_testa
  .complete(); // Balances the transaction and initiates coin selection

const signedTx = await tx.sign.withWallet().complete();
const txHash = await signedTx.submit();
console.log(txHash);
```
