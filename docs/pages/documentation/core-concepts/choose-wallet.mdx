## Create a wallet

You are provided with multiple options to create and import a wallet

### Private Key

Generate a new private key

```typescript
const privateKey = generatePrivateKey(); // Bech32 encoded private key
console.log(privateKey);
```

### Seed Phrase

Generate a new seed phrase (mnemonic)

```typescript
const seedPhrase = generateSeedPhrase(); // BIP-39
console.log(seedPhrase);
```

## Choosing Wallet

Use any suitable method to select a wallet and interact with the blockchain through it

### Private Key

Select a wallet using a private key

```typescript
lucid.selectWallet.fromPrivateKey(privateKey);
```

### Seed Phrase

Select a wallet using a seed phrase (mnemonic)

```typescript
const seedPhrase = "your seed phrase here...";
lucid.selectWallet.fromSeed(seedPhrase);
```

### Wallet API

If you're integrating with a wallet provider that exposes an API conforming to the `WalletApi` interface. This works for any [CIP-30](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0030) compliant wallet.

```typescript
// `externalWalletApi` is your wallet provider's API
const walletApi: WalletApi = externalWalletApi;
lucid.selectWallet.fromAPI(walletApi);
```

### Address-only

This method will create a limited wallet that can still query the address and its UTxOs. You can use it to build transactions that **others will sign**, as it cannot sign transactions (no private key).

```typescript
const address = "addr_test...";
const utxos = await lucid.utxosAt(address);
lucid.selectWallet.fromAddress(address, utxos);
```

<Callout type="warning">
Transactions built with an address-only wallet will need to be signed by a wallet with the actual private keys before they can be submitted.
</Callout>

## Query your wallet

Wallet queries are like asking "what's in my wallet?". You are able to fetch data associated with the selected wallet.

### Address

```typescript
const address = await lucid.wallet().address(); // Bech32 encodedaddress
```

### UTXOs

UTXOs associated with the selected wallet

```typescript
const utxos = await lucid.wallet().getUtxos();
```

### Delegation

Query your wallet's stake delegation status:

```typescript
const delegation = await lucid.wallet().getDelegation();
```
