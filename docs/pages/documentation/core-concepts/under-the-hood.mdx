## How does Evolution roughly work?

### Transaction Components

**Inputs** are existing UTxOs from your wallet that the transaction will consume. Evolution library automatically selects these to cover your output amounts plus transaction fees. Don't forget that each UTxO can only be spent once.

**Outputs** define the new UTxOs that your transaction will create. Each output must contain a minimum amount of ADA, which is determined by the current protocol parameters.

**Fees** are calculated automatically based on your transaction's size and any execution units used (for smart contracts). Evolution library handles this calculation for you, and fees are _-for now-_ always (looking at you [babel fees](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/02/25/babel-fees/)) paid in ADA (lovelace).

**Transaction Witnesses** are cryptographic signatures that prove you own the input UTxOs. These are added when you sign the transaction, either with your wallet or a private key.

<Callout type="info">
  **Understanding Values** - `lovelace` is the smallest unit of ADA (1 ADA =
  1,000,000 lovelace) - Values use BigInt notation (append `n` to numbers) -
  Example: `5000000n` = 5 ADA
</Callout>

### Coin Selection

When `.complete()` is called, Evolution library internally queries available UTxOs in your wallet and selects "optimal" UTxOs to cover certain criteria for succesful transaction building. UTxOs are selected based on these criteria:

- Output amounts
- Estimated transaction fee
- Minimum ADA requirements
- Creates a change output back to your wallet if needed

To be more specific, we can take a look at a basic case where you have these UTxOs in your wallet:

```typescript
[
  { amount: 3_000_000n }, // 3 ADA
  { amount: 10_000_000n }, // 10 ADA
  { amount: 1_000_000n }, // 1 ADA
]
```

You might want to send 5 ADA from that wallet. What Evolution concretely would do in that scenario is it will select the 10 ADA UTxO and pay 5 ADA to recipient. It will also pay ~0.18 ADA for fees (depending on protocol parameters) and return ~4.82 ADA (5 - 0.18) to your wallet as "change".

### Fee Calculation

Fees are automatically calculated based on a few things. It can be about transaction size in bytes, number of inputs and outputs or execution units (if using smart contracts, more on that [later](/documentation/deep-dives/smart-contract-interactions)).

<Callout type="info">
You can override coin selection by manually selecting UTxOs:

```typescript
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .collectFrom([specificUtxo]) // Manual UTxO selection
  .pay.ToAddress("addr_test...", { lovelace: 5000000n })
  .complete();
```
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Understanding Fee Calculation**

- The base fee uses two protocol parameters, `minFeeA` (fee per byte of transaction size) and `minFeeB` (constant fee added to every transaction)
- Additional fees are added for reference scripts based on their size
- When you need precise fee handling (e.g., sending maximum amount from a wallet), you can:

```typescript
// Draft the transaction to calculate the fee
  const draftTx = await lucid
    .newTx()
    .pay.ToAddress("addr_test...", { lovelace: amount })
    .complete();

  const fee = (await draftTx.complete()).toTransaction().body().fee();

  // Build the final transaction using calculated fee
  const finalTx = await lucid
    .newTx()
    .pay.ToAddress("addr_test...", { lovelace: amount - fee })
    .complete();
```
</Callout>

### CML Integration

CML (Cardano Multiplatform Library) provides low-level primitives for Cardano blockchain interactions, and Lucid Evolution heavily leverages CML for various core functionality.

- **Fee Estimation**: Evolution uses CML for base fee calculation, while handling specific cases like script execution fees (via local UPLC or providers) and reference script fees internally.

- **Key Management**: For operations like deriving addresses from private keys, Evolution provides high-level APIs (like `makeWalletFromPrivateKey`), but you can also use CML directly for more granular control:

```typescript
const pubKeyHash = CML.PrivateKey.from_bech32(privateKey)
  .to_public()
  .hash()
  .to_hex();
```

<Callout type="info">
  While Evolution abstracts most CML complexity, understanding that CML powers
  the core operations can help when you need fine-grained control or are
  debugging transaction issues.
</Callout>

### Hashing Functions

Lucid Evolution doesn't expose hash functions directly. Instead, it recommends using the [noble-hashes](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-hashes) library for cryptographic hashing needs, which is audited and secure.

- Compatible with both Node.js and browser environments
- Provides implementations of common hash functions including `blake2b` which is compatible with Aiken's on-chain hash functions

<Callout type="info">
  When working with smart contracts, ensure you're using the same hash function
  and parameters as your on-chain code. For example, if using Aiken's
  `blake2b_224`, configure noble-hashes accordingly.
