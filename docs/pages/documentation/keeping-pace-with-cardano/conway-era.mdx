## Governance and Conway Era

<Callout>This section is under construction üõ†Ô∏è</Callout>

In the Conway era, the Cardano blockchain is introducing significant governance features on-chain. These enhancements, as described in [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-1694), enable ADA holders
to participate in various on-chain decisions. Key changes include new script purposes, centralized data structures like committees, and new transaction features.

Lucid Evolution now supports various governance actions as defined in CIP-1694. These include delegating votes to DReps, registering as a DRep, and managing stake and vote delegations.

## As a ADA Holder

As an ADA holder, you can participate in governance through various voting strategies and delegation options.

<Steps>

### Delegation Options

**Delegate Vote to DRep** 

Delegates voting power from a reward address to a DRep
```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
  .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, drep)
```

**Delegate Vote to Pool and DRep**

Delegates both stake to a pool and voting power to a DRep in one action

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
  .delegate.VoteToPoolAndDrep(rewardAddress, poolId, drep)
```

---

### Registration and Delegation

**Register and Delegate to DRep**

Registers a stake address and delegates voting power to a DRep in one action

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
  .registerAndDelegate.ToDrep(rewardAddress, drep)
```

**Register and Delegate to Pool**

Registers a stake address and delegates stake to a pool 
```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
  .registerAndDelegate.ToPool(rewardAddress, poolId)
```

**Register and Delegate to Pool and DRep**

Registers a stake address, and delegates voting power to a DRep (In this case `AlwaysAbstain`) in one action

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
  .registerAndDelegate.ToPoolAndDRep(rewardAddress, poolId, {
      __typename: "AlwaysAbstain",
    })
```

---

### Voting Strategies

**Always Abstain**

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
    .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, {
      __typename: "AlwaysAbstain",
    })
```

You can also both delegate to a pool and vote to a DRep in one action

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
.newTx()
    .delegate.VoteToPoolAndDRep(rewardAddress, poolId, {
      __typename: "AlwaysAbstain",
    })
```

**Always No Confidence**

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
    .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, {
      __typename: "AlwaysNoConfidence",
    })
```

</Steps>

<Callout>
Choosing `AlwaysNoConfidence` or `AlwaysAbstain` requires a DRep object with `__typename` property set to the desired value, as it can be observed in the examples above
</Callout>

## As a DRep

As a DRep, you can perform the following actions

<Steps>

### Register as a DRep

Registers a stake address as a DRep

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
  .register.DRep(rewardAddress)
```

---

### Update DRep

Updates the information of a DRep

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
  .updateDRep(rewardAddress)
```

---

### Deregister DRep

Deregisters your stake address as a DRep

```typescript
await lucid.newTx()
  .deregister.DRep(rewardAddress)
```

---

</Steps>

## Script-based DReps

<Steps>

Lucid Evolution supports script-based DReps, allowing for programmatic voting behavior

### Register Script DRep

```typescript
await lucid
  .newTx()
  .register.DRep(rewardAddress)
  .attach.Script(script)
```

### Deregister Script DRep

```typescript
await lucid
  .newTx()
  .deregister.DRep(rewardAddress)
```

</Steps>

## Example

To utilize these methods, you need to initiate the `TxBuilder` configuration by calling `newTx()` after `Lucid` is initialized

```typescript
  // You can define a DRep object
  const drep: DRep = { __typename: "AlwaysAbstain" }; // Example AlwaysAbstain DRep

  // Create and complete the transaction
  const tx = await lucid
    .newTx()
    .delegate.VoteToDRep(rewardAddress, drep)
    .complete();
```
