## Governance and Conway Era

<Callout>This section is under construction üõ†Ô∏è</Callout>

In the Conway era, the Cardano blockchain is introducing significant governance features on-chain. These enhancements, as described in [CIP-1694](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-1694), enable ADA holders
to participate in various on-chain decisions. Key changes include new script purposes, centralized data structures like committees, and new transaction features.

Lucid Evolution now supports various governance actions as defined in CIP-1694. These include delegating votes to DReps, registering as a DRep, and managing stake and vote delegations.

### Delegate Vote to DRep

Delegates voting power from a reward address to a DRep

```typescript
await lucid.delegateVoteToDrep(rewardAddress, drepId);
```

### Delegate Vote to Pool and DRep

Delegates both stake to a pool and voting power to a DRep

```typescript
await lucid.delegateVoteToPoolAndDrep(rewardAddress, poolId, drepId);
```

### Register and Delegate to DRep

Registers a stake address and delegates voting power to a DRep in one action

```typescript
await lucid.registerAndDelegateToDrep(rewardAddress, drepId);
```

### Deregister DRep

Deregisters your stake address as a DRep

```typescript
await lucid.deregisterDrep(rewardAddress);
```

## Example

As these methods need `TxBuilderConfig`, they are initiated with `newTx()`

```typescript
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .delegateVoteToDrep(rewardAddress, drepId)
  .complete(); 

const signedTx = await tx.sign.withWallet().complete();
const txHash = await signedTx.submit();
```

## Governance Era Validators

Lucid Evolution now supports attaching validators specific to governance actions:

### voteValidator

Attaches a validator script for voting on governance actions, which will ensure that votes are cast according to the rules defined in CIP-1694

```typescript
const tx = await lucid
  .newTx()
  .attachVoteValidator(voteValidator)
  .complete();
```

### proposeValidator

Attaches a validator script for proposing new governance actions, to make sure that the proposal is valid according to the specified rules 

These functions are used internally when creating transactions for voting or proposing governance actions. They ensure that the appropriate validation logic is included in the transaction.
