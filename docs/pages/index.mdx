Hello fellow developers, welcome to Lucid Evolution! 

This is the next iteration of the Lucid library which is being maintained by Anastasia Labs, after evaluations of the legacy Lucid library we identified areas needing enhancements. In this effort, a big portion of the legacy library has been rewritten or created from scratch. Lucid Evolution is like the legacy Lucid library but with improved APIs, better error handling, more structure, and the latest version of CML.
