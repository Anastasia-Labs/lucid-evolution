# Governance and Conway Era

-UNDER CONSTRUCTION-

In the Conway era, the Cardano blockchain is introducing significant governance features on-chain. These enhancements, as described in CIP-1694(https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-1694), enable ADA holders
to participate in various on-chain decisions. Key changes include new script purposes, centralized data structures like committees, and new transaction features.

## Proposal procedures

To describe proposal procedures and attach an arbitrary number of those in transaction skeletons. The balancing mechanism will take into account the required deposit for each of these procedures.

## Parameter changes

To issue proposal procedures with a request for changes in parameters. If a script witness is attached to this proposal (typically the constitution script), it will be ran against the proposal. All kinds of parameter changes are supported, except for the cost models, which contain too many values and are not even yet taken into account by the current constitution.

## Treasury withdrawals

To issue proposal procedures with a request for treasury withdrawals. If a script witness is attached to this proposal (typically the constitution script), it will be ran against the proposal.
