# Transition

## Acknowledgements

Lucid owes its origins to Spacebudz [alessandrokonrad](https://github.com/alessandrokonrad), who initially developed it as an open-source offering.
In late 2023, when maintenance ceased, Anastasia Labs and others stepped up to the challenge of preserving and enhancing the codebase.

## Why Maintain the Lucid Library?

Lucid is indispensable as a core library in Cardano, underpinning numerous protocols. This role necessitates consistent updates to ensure compatibility with evolving Cardano protocols, hard forks, and the ever-changing landscape. Neglecting Lucid's maintenance jeopardizes not only smart contract interaction functionality but also impacts the multitude of protocols relying on it. Upholding Lucid's reliability is integral to sustaining operations across our blockchain.
Our strategy involves a meticulous upgrade process, aligning the library with the latest Cardano Multiplatform Library (CML) versions to address potential compatibility issues and disruptions. We propose a holistic approach encompassing maintenance, hard fork compatibility, GitHub issue resolution, pull request management, and community development.
The benefits include increased stability, seamless adaptation to protocol upgrades, faster issue resolution, enhanced features, and a resilient ecosystem fostering collaborative innovation. Our goal is to create a Cardano ecosystem that is robust, reliable, and adaptable to the evolving needs of its developer base.
While the Evolution library shares the Lucid name, it employs a different approach. We've strived to ensure a smooth transition, maintaining similar endpoints and core concepts with only minor API changes.

## Effect Library

Lucid Evolution uses the Effect library to handle complex operations in TypeScript. This helps manage errors better, makes async code easier to work with, and improves performance. It also catches more errors at compile-time. Advanced users can create custom effects, manage dependencies, run tasks in parallel, and write better tests.

The library makes it easier to write and understand code that deals with many async operations at once. This is especially useful in blockchain development, where many operations happen in sequence.
