### Why Compartmentalize Packages?

Lucid Evolution separates packages to allow users to import only what they need, which gives us a chance for better performance and flexibility. For instance, as demonstrated in `Core-Concept 1`, you can import just the `lucid` and `provider` packages without needing the entire library:

```typescript
import { Lucid } from "@lucid-evolution/lucid";
import { Blockfrost } from "@lucid-evolution/provider"; 

const lucid = await Lucid(
  new Blockfrost("https://cardano-mainnet.blockfrost.io/api/v0", "<projectId>"),
  "Mainnet"
);
```
